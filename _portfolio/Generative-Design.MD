## Project Details

* **Top-Down Modeling** Top-down modeling allowed the parts of this project to be designed parametrically based on other components in the assembly. Creating multiple components meant that I could use the measurements directly in Fusion, instead of having to take manual measurements. By activating the component I was working on, the design stayed organized and clear. One obstacle I encountered was that you could only reference components earlier in the timeline, which made me unable to rely on certain parts whe modeling other parts. In the future, I would avoid this by thinking through the timing more and giving more thought to the flow of the design.
* **My Design** In order to make the mount adjustable for various phone sizes in different orientations, I utilized a makeshift self-centering vice. By creating a screw that has both left handed and right handed threading, the parts that grip the phone have opposite directions of motion when the screw is rotated, allowing for it to easily open or close around the phone. The parts that grip the phone have a gradually sloped angle, allowing for a snug fit regardless of the width of the phone. The handlebar grip is compatible with 23-25mm handlebars.
* **Material Choice** While most components were filament printed using PLA, the screw that mimics the self-centering vice was printed using SLA with resin. The threaded features on the screw required a higher resolution than filament printing could provide.
* **Assembly Instructions** The only potential tool needed to assemble this mount is an allen key for a M5 bolt. Tighten the handlebar grip at the desired orientation. Line up the center of the screw with the holder on the mount, ensuring that the notches on the two phone grips are also aligned with the rod. Use the knob to open and close the phone grips to the desired position.
