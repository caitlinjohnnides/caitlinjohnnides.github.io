## Project Details

* **Top-Down Modeling**
* **My Design** 
* **Material Choice** Particles will align to the a side wall based on the flow rates of the two inlets. The flow rate ratio of the particle-containing inlet to the buffer inlet must be 1:6.
* **Assembly Instructions** Microfluidic sorters are popular among biology researchers because they operate in a very small space, eradicate the need for bulky pieces of equipment, are affordable, and require minimal sample preparation. Given these benefits, microfluidic sorters enable lab-on-a-chip devices for cellular sorting, analysis, and experimental processing. Any lab that does cell research could use microfluidic sorters for these benefits. Cell sorting could also be used in diagnostics.
